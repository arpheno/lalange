### **UI Concept**

1. **Progress bar**  
2. **Theming**

**UX**

3. **The "Lacanian Cut" Settings:** \* **The Scansion Pause:** A slider for the duration of the "Black Screen" between chapters (0s to 10s).  
   * **The Session Limit:** "Force-stop reading after [X] minutes" to prevent cognitive burnout.  
4. **Haptic/Audio Heartbeat:** \* **[Toggle] Metronome:** A tiny "click" or phone vibration on every 10th word to lock the brain into a rhythmic trance.  
5. **The "Export to Memory" Button:** \* One click to save the AI's stylized summary of the current chapter to a "Local Memory Log" so you don't forget the plot at 800 WPM.

### **Summary: The "Manifesto" UI**

The UI shouldn't look like a standard web app. It should look like a **Terminal** or a **Diagnostic Tool**.

* **Font:** Monospace (IBM Plex Mono).  
* **Colors:** Cyber-Green or Lacanian-Red on Pitch Black.  
* **Signal:** High-density controls for high-density reading.
* **Controls:**
    * **No "Engage" Button:** The text itself is the control. Click to play/pause.
    * **Symbolic Controls:** Minimal icons for essential actions only.
    * **Subtitle Header:** The book title and chapter title appear discreetly in the top bar, keeping the focus on the stream.
