This is the "Shovel" at its most sophisticated. By building this **Cognitive Cockpit**, you aren't just giving them a reader; you're giving them a "Brain-Computer Interface" for literature.

Here is the architectural breakdown for the **Settings**  
I want the  settings both in one control panel in general for all settings but i also want a quick settings button in each of the modes that opens the settings for this specific part of the tool.   
For each function of the

### **I. The Janitor’s Station (Preprocessing)**

*Rule-based scrubbing to ensure the "Real" doesn't clutter the "Imaginary."*

* **\[Toggle\] License Annihilator:** Detects and hard-removes Project Gutenberg/Standard Ebooks legal headers via string-matching and regex.  
* **\[Toggle\] Structural Scrubber:** Strips out "Chapter 1," page numbers, and Transcriber’s notes.  
* **\[Toggle\] Footnote Suppressor:** Hides \[1\] or (p. 42\) references that trigger "eye-glitch" in RSVP.  
* **\[Mode\] Manual Override:** A text area where the user can add their own "Global Find & Replace" rules (e.g., *Change "Rand" to "The Dragon"*).

### **II. The Word Processor (Transformation)**

*The JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler for the style and tone of your feed.*

* **Model Selection:**  
  * **Tier 1:** *Tiny* (Qwen-0.5B) – For instant, low-power cleaning.  
  * **Tier 2:** *Balanced* (Llama-3.2-3B) – For nuanced editing and light styling.  
  * **Tier 3:** *Pro* (Llama-3-8B / Mistral-7B) – For deep "Jack Sparrow" style transformations.  
* **\[Toggle\] Auto-Upgrade Neural Engine:** Starts with a Tiny model for Chapter 1 and silently swaps to a Pro model once the 4GB buffer is downloaded.  
* **Styling Cockpit:**  
  * **Presets:** *The Analyst, The Pirate, The Zoomer, The Stoic, The Victorian.*  
  * **Free-Text Persona:** "Rewrite as \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\]."  
  * **Intensity Slider:** (0% \= Raw Cleaned Text; 100% \= Total Stylistic Re-hallucination).

### **III. The Pacing Engine (Annotation)**

*Modulating the WPM based on the complexity of the "Signal."*

* **Analysis Granularity:**  
  * **Paragraph Level:** AI assigns a single speed (Low/Mid/High) to the whole block. (Fastest, smoothest).  
  * **Sentence Level:** Speed shifts as the author’s logic fluctuates.  
  * **Word Level:** Specific "Deep" words slow down individually. (Highest jouissance/intensity).  
* **Sensitivity Dial:** \* **"The Wall":** How much should the speed drop when density is detected? (e.g., *Standard 500 WPM drops to 200 WPM during a philosophical rant*).  
* **Ye we probably want a scale here**

### **IV. The Librarian (The Prescriber)**

*The "Trust-First" discovery engine.*

* **Librarian Model:** Choose which "Brain" recommends your next book (e.g., Mistral for a European/Lacanian bias, Llama for a broad American bias).  
* **Prompt Presets:** \* *"I want something that feels like \[Dropped Book\]."*  
  * *"Prescribe me a book for Existential Dread."*  
* **The Affiliate Disclosure:** A subtle UI badge showing: *"Librarian logic is local. Amazon links support this project."* (Maintains trust).
